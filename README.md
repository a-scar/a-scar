ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m Anthony Scardapane. I work at Cisco, where I'm part of the team behind [Cx Cloud](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/services/cx-cloud/index.html), a popular enterprise application. I also run a personal blog over at [anthonyscardapane.com](https://anthonyscardapane.com), where I like to share my thoughts and teachings. I truly love programming, so if you ever want to chat about code or just nerd out, don't hesitate to reach out â€“ I'm always up for it!
